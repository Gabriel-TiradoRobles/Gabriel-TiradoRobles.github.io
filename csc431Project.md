Scheduling Algorithms
===============

-   **Class:** CSCI-431
-   **Grade:** TBD
-   **Language(s):** C
-   **Source Code Repository:**  https://github.com/Gabriel-TiradoRobles/CSCI-431-Final-Project
    (Please [email me](mailto:gjtiradorobles@csustudent.net?subject=GitHub%20Access) to request access.)

## Project description

The scheduling algorithms project for CSCI-431 required us to create 5 different algorithms that would simulate different ways an operating system would schedule processes to run on the CPU. The 5 algorithms that were created are:
- First Come First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Priority Scheduling
- Round Robin
- Priority Round Robin

## How to compile and run the program

There are different commands for making each specific scheduling algorithm the code below will compile each of the algorithms. Make sure you are in the same directory as all the C files and MakeFile

```bash
make fcfs
make sjf
make priority
make rr
make priority_rr
```

For running the compiled programs, run the following commands in the same directory the files were compiled for the coresponding algorithm.
```bash
./schedule_fcfs.o
./schedule_sjf.o
./schedule_priority.o
./schedule_rr.o
./schedule_priority_rr.o
```

## UI Design

When the project for CSCI-315 has been completed, this page will be filled out. Currently the class is in progress

**Fig 1. Placeholder until the project has been completed.**

## 3. Additional Considerations

Note that these programs were created in Ubuntu and will require either a linux computer to run the make commands to compile the program or a virtual machine that can run a linux distribution.
